# HSK Traditional Characters List

A list of HSK characters that are different for Traditional/Simplified characters, ideal for switching between simplified/traditional characters during your learning

The resulting list is available in the `./out/` folder, including JSON, txt files for the characters, and statistics about simplified/traditional character amounts.

## Learning Traditional Chinese Characters
These lists can be used for different reasons -- however, it's incredibly helpful when learning traditional Chinese characters, when you only know the simplified ones.

You can create a writing practice sheet using a tool such as the [PurpleCulture Chinese Practice Worksheet Generator](https://www.purpleculture.net/chinese-practice-sheet/). For this, simply copy the output in the `hsk-{level}-different-traditional.txt` files into the generator.
